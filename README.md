3D simulation of the electrostatic energy-analyzer of beam of charged particles

First project in Delphi with OpenGL for science project in physics class in my high school.

The project plays 3D animation of the electrostatic enery-analyzer. Also some control is provided via mouse and keyboard.

User can zoom in and out with both mouse and keyboard. Pan the object with mouse. Rotate the object with arrows keys. 
Pause with P key. Cut half of the object with C key.
